(Fast) graph homomorphism searching for Sage
============================================

The core branching alg. is implemented in Cython for speed.
Accepts partial maps. Optionally looks for homomorphisms in the target graph.

Includes a heuristic for branching vertex ordering, homomorphism
core finding, routines for cube-like (Cayley) graphs, some experiments,
and tests.
